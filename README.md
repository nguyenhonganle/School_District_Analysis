## Overview of the school district analysis
The motivation behind the undertaking is to examine the accompanying information of the High Schools previously, then after the fact a potential scholarly contemptibly, where the information for the ninth Grade of Thomas High School has been maintained for the examination reason. We have supplanted the math and perusing scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the remainder of the information unblemished. We will examine the information previously, then after the fact roll out this improvement. 

  - The district summary.
  - The school summary.
  - The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
  - The average math score for each grade level from each school.
  - The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
  - The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.
  
## Results

### District Summary
In looking at the locale outline information, there was little adverse consequence of eliminating the ninth-grade information of Thomas High School. This is the primary level when we start to see that the scores at that level were reasonably swelled - probably the number-related scores were the significant supporter of score expansion.

  - Average Math Scores: moved from 79 to 78.9 (.1 point) as a result of this change.
  - Average Reading Scores did not change
  - % Passing Math moved from 75% to 74% (delta: 1 percentage point)
  - % Passing Reading moved from 86% to 85% (1 percentage point)
  - % Overall Passing moved from 65% to 64% (1 percentage point)

### School Summary
At the school level, it's a good idea to zero in just on Thomas High, since the scores at different schools were not influenced. When seeing normal scores the effect was not as extraordinary as when taking a gander at the % who passed math, perusing and by and large. Here is the synopsis:

  - Average math at Thomas decreased from 83.42 to 83.35
  - Average reading at Thomas slightly increased from 83.84 to 83.89 (less than .1 point)
  - Average percent passing Math at Thomas greatly decreased from 93.3% to 66.9% (26.7 percentage points)
  - Percent Passing Reading at Thomas decreases from 97.3% to 69.7% (27.6 percentage points)
  - Average percent overall passing both Math and Reading decreased from 90.9% to 65.1% (25.8 percentage points)

### Scores by Spending Level
When taking a gander at the general passing rates by spending level, there is an impact at the per capita levels of $630-644, which might be an antiquity of the spending level for Thomas High (at this equivalent level). With the evacuation of the ninth-grade scores, the general passing rate diminished from 62.9% to 56.4% (6.5% lessening).

### Scores by School Type
There were two school types in the informational collection: District and Charter schools. For the most part, the Charter schools showed higher scholastic execution, even with the expulsion of the presumed ninth-grade Thomas High scores. Since Thomas was not a District school type, there would not be any normal impact on the locale-type schools. For the Charter, consequently, the progressions were as per the following:

  - Average math scores declined from 83.47 to 83.46 (only a very slightly .1 point).
  - Average reading scores were slightly higher: 83.89 compared to 83.9 (.1 point)
  - % Passing math declined from 93.6 to 90.3 (3.3 percentage points)
  - % Passing reading declined from 96.6% to 93.1% (3.5 percentage points)
  - % Overall passing decreased from 90.4% to 87.2% (3.2 percentage points)
  
### Scores by School Size

An extra examination was directed by making another DataFrame analyze key execution pointers by school size. For this, I utilized a comparative technique as utilized for per capita spending levels. Assessment of the information and experimentation of the most impartial order yielded four classes, dependent on size. The littlest school had 427 understudies and the biggest 4,976 understudies. I made four classes with the accompanying receptacles: 0-1500 (3 schools, "little"), 1501-2840 (6 medium estimated schools), 2841-4260 (3 enormous schools) lastly, 4261-4976 (3 extremely huge schools). Evacuation of the ninth-grade Thomas High scores didn't influence execution. 

In any case, it should be noticed that there is a considerable contrast in execution dependent on school size, with the enormous and exceptionally huge schools showing a lot of lower execution on every single key marker. Allude to the Jupyter Notebook segment that presents the examination by school size.

## Summary
> The three significant changes in the refreshed school area investigation in the wake of perusing and math scores for the 10th grade at Thomas High School have been supplanted with NaNs. 

  - Thomas High School was positioned second and exited the best 5 schools right to the number 8 situation after the change. 

  - The rate of passing understudies for math, perusing, and generally speaking was additionally fundamentally influenced at school and grade level for Thomas High School after the change. 

  - All scholastic boundaries identified with math, perusing, and in the general score were definitely dropped whichever classification of type, size, and school spending per understudy Thomas Secondary School fell into.
